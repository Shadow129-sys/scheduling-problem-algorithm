This is the solution of a Google Interview Question asked in a video (Google Coding Interview With A College Student) in Clement Mihailescu's channel

## Main Video
[problem-statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q_oYDQ2whs&t=2320s)

## Libraries Required :computer:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <math.h>
```

## Prerequisites
- basic understanding of algorithmic complexity
- Greedy algorithm

## Understanding The Code :key:
</p>Please read the code carefully everything is written in the comments, if you still have difficulty understanding the code then dryrun the code hopefully it will make the concept clear for you.</p>
