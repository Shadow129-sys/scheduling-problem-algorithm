# scheduling-problem-algorithm
This is the solution of a Google Interview Question asked in a video (Google Coding Interview With A College Student) in Clement Mihailescu's channel

## Main Video
The actual problem statement for this algorithm was asked by Clement Mihailescu in his youtube channel [link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaO6VoaYJv4kS-TQO_M-N_g) in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q_oYDQ2whs&t=2320s) 

## Libraries Required :computer:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <math.h>
```

## Prerequisites
- basic understanding of algorithmic complexity
- Greedy algorithm

## Understanding The Code :key:
Please read the code carefully everything is written in the comments, if you still have difficulty understanding the code then dryrun the code hopefully it will make the concept clear for you.

## FAQ
1.how to compile and run c++ code?
Mac OS
```terminal
g++ filename.cpp -o outputFile
./outputFile
```
Windows
```terminal
g++ filename.cpp -o outputFile
outputFile.exe
```

2.g++ command not working
For Windows
Install MinGW in your pc and add the path of bin folder in MinGW to system variable 'path'.
## For Linux
```terminal
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt install g++
```

Then open terminal and check the version of your gcc.
```terminal
gcc --version
```
It will show your MinGW version.
